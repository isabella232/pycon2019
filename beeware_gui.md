# How to build GUI Widgets using BeeWare

This is basically a talk on how to use the library [`toga`](https://toga.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Tl;dr - RTFM

This talk is more or less a description/walk-through of some Python widget libraries (tkinter, et. al).
Point of walkthrough is that we should use prior art to understand how others have built widget arch/frameworks.

Emphasizes lots of documentation, clear intent of arch.

Then back to toga.

Did I mention toga?

Lots of code samples.

Interesting to see the differences between procedural/drawing APIs and "widget" libraries (or app frameworks with components).

Toga.
